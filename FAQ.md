# How long are the Zoom calls?
We will stick to the 40-minute limit that Zoom free prescribes (this 'limit' is one of the reasons we prefer the free plan to the paid one).

# When are the Zoom calls?
This will depend on the timezones of the people who are selected. We are provisionally aiming for 16h30 UTC+2 every Monday, but we will run a poll in early May 
to find a time that works for everyone.

# Will there be any other meetings on Slack channel?  Or will slack channel be just for giving updates and getting help?
We will post daily updates on the Slack channel regarding goals and resources. Participants will post their own goals and share their work too. We expect (hope) that 
the channel will be very active, but nearly everything will be asynchronous, so you can share and catch up on your own schedule instead of needing to be available at 
specific times.

# What are the time requirements and distribution?
We are estimating 20h/week, and we ask that people are avaiable Monday thru Thursday for several hours per day to keep momentum. Many people have asked if they can 
fit most of the hours into the weekends, and the answer is *probably not*. This is an intensive course and you are unlikely to get value from it unless it can be your 
**main focus** for the four weeks. That said, it is asynchronous, so if you are extremely dedicated and can fit in 2 hours each week day and extra time on the 
weekends, we might be able to make it work out.
