# Learn to write by writing - a four week introductory course.

Most people who can code are scared of writing words in a "natural" language like English. Most people who have mastered writing are self-confessed technophobes, 
and think coding is one of the Dark Arts, reserved for those people who liked maths and science in high school.

Those who have learned to code *and* write have realised that it is one of the most valuable skill-combos of today's world. CTOs and other tech leaders are amongst the best-paid and most in-demand people in the world right now, but -- even ignoring that -- you can almost certainly be better at your current profession by adding either great writing or rudimentary coding to your skillset, and preferably both. 

Many developers want to get better at writing, whether that's for direct needs like writing documentation or technical articles, or simply to improve their general communication skills to open doors to promotions and to work more effectively with their teams.

But writing is hard. Everyone can put words down on a page, but getting them in the right order is pretty tricky. 

The best way to learn writing is by doing it. A lot. The first million words are the hardest, and most of us are still tapping away to get to that mark.

Ritza's newly launched technical writing course will teach you to be a better writer. You will spend 20h/week learning to write, mainly by doing it. You will also get personalised suggested resources from us, and personalised feedback on your writing to help you improve. If you like it, you might be able to turn it into your profession by writing for us as a career.

## What is the course and who is it for?

Ritza's *Learn to Write by Writing* is a four week intensive fully remote course, run mainly on Slack with weekly meetings on Zoom. It is primarily for people who have at least some experience with software development and focuses on teaching people how to write for a developer audience.

You will join a cohort of four people. One other person will be doing exactly the same course as you, and the other two will be writers doing our "Learning 
Coding for Writers" course. While all of you will receive guidance and feedback from our professional [technical publishing team](#) throughout the course, you will also help and support each other, reviewing each other's work and learning from that alongside your own.

You will share daily updates of your progress on our Slack channel and get help (usually within minutes) if you get stuck with any of the materials or exercises. You will go through our generic list of writing resources, including book excerpts and videos, as well as resources assigned to you specifically based on where you are with your writing and what you're struggling with.
